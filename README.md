# SecurePass ðŸ”‘
This Python script is designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords and encourage them to create more secure ones. It utilizes the file "10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt" file from https://github.com/danielmiessler to make your passwords more secure and harder for attackers to brute force.
